plenc is a serialisation library based around protobuf. It uses a very similar encoding to protobuf, but it does not use .proto files or the protobuf data definition language. Instead Go structs are used to define how messages are encoded.

plenc needs you to annotate your structs with a plenc tag on each field. The tag either indicates that the field should not be encoded, or provides a persistent index number that's used for that field in the encoding. The indexes within a struct must all be unique and should not be changed. You may remove fields, but you should not re-use the index number of a removed field. You should not change the type of a field. You can change field names as these are not used in the encoding.

Tags look like the following.

```go
type mystruct struct {
	A  int     `plenc:"1"`
	B  string  `plenc:"-"` // This field is not encoded
	C  float64 `plenc:"2"`
}
```

The `plenctag` tool will add tags to structs for you.

plenc only encodes fields that are exported - ones where the field name begins with a capital letter.

Once you've added plenc tags to your structs then encoding and decoding looks very like the JSON standard library. The one difference is that the Marshal function allows you to append encoded data to an existing slice.

```go
var in mystruct 
data, err := plenc.Marshal(data[:0], &in)
if err != nil {
	return err
}

var out mystruct
if err := plenc.Unmarshal(data, &out); err != nil {
	return err
}
```

## Why do this?

The idea behind plenc is to unlock the performance of protobuf for folk who don't like the Go structs generated by the protobuf compiler and don't want the hassle of creating .proto files. It is for people who want to retrofit better serialisation to a system that's started with JSON.

Here's a rough benchmark to show the kind of gains you could get using plenc.
